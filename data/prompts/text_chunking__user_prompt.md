Below is the extracted text from a document.

Your task is to read the text carefully and split it into **coherent, topic-focused chunks**.

Rules:
- Each chunk must focus on **one clear topic or idea**.
- Do **not** summarize, paraphrase, rewrite, or modify the text in any way.
- Do **not** skip or omit any content. Every character must appear in exactly one chunk.
- Preserve the **exact text and formatting** as it appears, including:
  - Paragraph breaks
  - Lists and bullet points
  - Punctuation and capitalization
  - Quotes and emphasis
- Each chunk must be **self-contained and semantically meaningful** on its own.
- Do not split sentences, arguments, examples, or lists across chunks unless the topic clearly changes.

Return your output **exactly** in the format specified by the provided schema.
Do not include any explanations or text outside the JSON object.
