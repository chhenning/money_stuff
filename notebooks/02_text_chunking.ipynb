But the fun hipster alternative is, what if *venture capital* buys up every company and comes to dominate the economy? Historically no one worried about that much, because historically venture capital was about making concentrated bets on small startups that might change the world, not about buying the local pest-control company or medical practice in every town in America. But that’s changing.'),\n",
       " TextChunk(id=2, chunk='We have talked a few times about “AI rollups,” where a venture capital firm buys a bunch of small companies, combines them, and sprinkles them with artificial intelligence. One way to think about it is that each of PE and VC has a powerful general-purpose technology that it can apply indiscriminately to every company. PE’s magic technology is leverage: You buy the local plumber or pest control company or medical practice, you put a lot of non-recourse debt on it, you get a lot of upside if it does well and limited downside if it does poorly. VC’s magic technology is artificial intelligence: You buy the local plumber or pest control company or medical practice, you replace the customer-service reps and bookkeepers with AI agents, you cut costs and improve profits, and eventually you also replace the plumbers and exterminators and doctors with AI and then you really start to make money.'),\n",

The roll-up strategy creates an avenue for VCs to generate liquidity from their portfolios at a time when initial public offerings and dealmaking have slowed. > Where private equity firms typically make heavy use of debt and slash costs in a roll-up, VCs claim improvements to efficiency and margins will come from infusing technology into the companies. > [Thrive Capital-backed wealth startup] Savvy, for instance, is using AI to take on back office tasks such as pulling data for the half a dozen forms that might be needed for any one transaction.'),\n",

VC firms have a pleasing combination of (1) being in the business of raising capital and investing in companies and (2) being tech-focused and enthusiastic about AI. But it is not obvious to me that VC firms are staffed with lots of domain experts in AI. Arguably the people who should be doing the AI rollups are *AI companies*. In that vein, here is a blog post from AI lab Anthropic about how it got into the vending-machine business:'),\n",

In particular, Claudius was told that it did not have to focus only on traditional in-office snacks and beverages and could feel free to expand to more unusual items.'),\n",

As we’ll explain, it made too many mistakes to run the shop successfully. However, at least for most of the ways it failed, we think there are clear paths to improvement—some related to how we set up the model for this task and some from rapid improvement of general model intelligence.'),\n",
